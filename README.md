  - AND Gate
  - OR Gate
  - NOT Gate
  - NAND Gate
  - NOR Gate
  - XOR Gate

- **Adders & Subtractors**:
  - Half Adder
  - Full Adder
  - Half Subtractor
  - Full Subtractor

- **Comparators**:
  - 2-Bit Comparator

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap 5
- Font Awesome

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/digital_logic_calculator.git
   cd digital_logic_calculator
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser:
   - On Windows, you can double-click the `index.html` file, or right-click and choose "Open with" > your preferred browser.

## Usage

1. Select the desired operation from the dropdown menu:
   - Basic Gates: AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR
   - Adders: Half Adder, Full Adder
   - Subtractors: Half Subtractor, Full Subtractor
   - Comparator: 2-Bit Comparator

2. Input the required binary values:
   - For basic gates, select binary inputs (A and B) using radio buttons.
   - For NOT Gate, only input A is required.
   - For Full Adder and Full Subtractor, an additional Carry/Borrow input is required.
   - For the 2-Bit Comparator, input two 2-bit binary numbers (A and B).

3. Click the **"Calculate"** button to see the results.

4. Results will be displayed in both binary and decimal format (where applicable).
